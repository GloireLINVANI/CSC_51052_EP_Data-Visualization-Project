Done:

- general layout to select a precise event json (one game file)
- 3 sections html pages to separate work from students
- add data files to the project (heavy but necessary)
-

ToDo:

- Visualizations part 1
- Visualizations part 3
- Visualizations part 2 :
  - filter ctx.gameData to get a new ctxP2 context to create viz
  - Organize all ideas into a custom dashboard for this part
- Reorganize the files (modify the paths in the code accordingly) into a better organization
- Interactions between the 3 parts (click in a part triggers a viz in another part)
-
